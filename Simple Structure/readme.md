# Basic architecture for SASS

**Base**: contained within this file are all your resets, variables, mixins, and any utility classes.

**Layout**: contains all the CSS that handles the layout, such as the container and any grid systems.

**Components**: anything reusable such as buttons, navbars, cards etc.

**Main**: it should ONLY contain the imports for the above files.

#### If any file grows too cluttered or disorganized, itâ€™s time to expand our structure. Consider adding a folder for your components for example, and breaking it up into individual files such as \_button.scss & \_carousel.scss
